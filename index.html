  <center><h1> Geography faculty vocal in Saunders renaming</h1></center>
  <p> By Langston Taylor</p>
  
  <p>The controversial decision Thursday to strike former Ku Klux Klan leader William Saunders' name from Saunders Hall came after years of activism led by students. However, geography faculty - who work in the building - were particularly vocal proponents of the name change as well, much more so than those in other departments.</p>

<p>The board accepted public commentary on the issue from March 25 to April 25. During that period, it received over 700 comments - over 200 from students, 79 from faculty and staff, and the rest from members of the community, some of which were serious entries and others that appeared to be spam. (Submitted names included, for example, "Hitler").</p>

<p>Scott Kirsch, an associate geography professor who has worked in the department for fifteen years said that the connection between the renaming movement and geography faculty and students might go beyond their location on campus.</p>

<p>"Some of us actually study landscape and the way landscape affects cultural identity," Kirsch said. "Some of us were especially conscious of how names can make an impact."</p>

<p>Of the 79 letters submitted by faculty and staff, 58 reported names and email addresses matching those of UNC-Chapel Hill faculty. 10 came from within the geography department, all of which specifically calling for the building to be renamed. Faculty in the school of nursing submitted six entries, four calling for a renaming and biology faculty submitted five letters, all supporting the decision. No other department submitted more than three letters from faculty.</p>

<p>As a whole, faculty overwhelmingly called for the removal of the name Saunders. 86 percent called for a new name. Just seven letters - 12 percent - asked to keep "Saunders" on the building, two of which included a suggestion that UNC-CH contextualize its history with an exhibit or plaque. One made no clear suggestion.</p>

<p>Kirsch's 1,200-word letter lamented "an unpleasant irony for Geography faculty and students learning to understand how cultural landscapes and built environments can serve to reflect and to shape our identities and social relations in powerful ways, such as through seemingly innocuous practices of naming places, to have to continue to work in a building named after this reprehensible figure from the state's history."</p>

<p>Gabriela Valdivia, another geography professor who submitted a letter, thought the board moved in the right direction with its action.</p>

<p>"The name change is a positive step, small and limiting, but nonetheless a visible response to the concerns of our brilliant students, and the faculty and staff that support them," Valdivia said in an email.</p>

<p>The board's resolutions to choose the name "Carolina Hall" over famed black writer Zora Neale Hurston, who may have taken classes at UNC-CH, as many students and faculty had suggested, and enact a 16-year freeze on renaming any other buildings on campus, riled many students.</p>

<p>Hurston was by far the most common namesake suggested by faculty, although most letters didn't suggest any name at all. 33 of the 50 calling for renaming gave no suggestion. 11 recommended Hurston. Two suggested civil rights activist Pauli Murray, and others gave general guidelines for the type of person they would like to see honored. No letter suggested "Carolina Hall."</p>

<p>Kirsch said he understood why the board might want to take some time to figure out its approach but called the 16-year freeze "kind of arbitrary."</p>

<p>"I guess at one level, I'm relieved and I'm pleased that they got rid of the Saunders name," he said. "For me that was the key issue much more than the Hurston Hall idea."</p>

<p>Valdivia said the work should not end here.</p>

<p>"We need to continue thinking of this as more than a single event but as part of how we make our institution a relevant educational space. Something that springs change forward," she said.</p>
