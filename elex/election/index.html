  <p>Volunteers said they also struggled with informing voters of their rights. Many had heard of the law requiring a state identification to vote without knowing the law had been struck down</p>
  <p>That nearly included one voter from Elizabeth City.</p>
  <p>Khalif Williams, a black 22-year-old, voted around 6:30 p.m. on election day. He said he didn't find out he could vote without an ID until just three hours before that.</p>
  <p>Williams said he was a fan of allowing voting without an ID.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It keeps things simple,&rdquo; he said.</p>
  <p>Paulette Spelman, a retired school teacher of thirty years and mother of eight, was waiting in the parking lot in front of River Road Middle School while her daughter voted inside.</p>
  <p>She said she voted early to avoid long lines.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I can't stand that long,&rdquo; she said.</p>
  <p>Though she said the poll closures were inconvenient for some, she remained optimistic about voting in North Carolina.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I believe in the system,&rdquo; she said.</p>
